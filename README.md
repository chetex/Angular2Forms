# Angular 2 Todo List Example

This is an example of a todo list (currently in progress), in order to introduce core concepts of Angular 2.

Right now the app contains a list of predefined items, retrieved from a service and displayed in a component. The component also uses another component with details of selected item.

The topics covered in this project are:

* **Modules**
* **Components**
* **Templates**
* **Metadata**
* **Data Binding**
* **Directives**
* **Services**
* **Dependency Injection**
